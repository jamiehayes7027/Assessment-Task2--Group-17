we have setup a discord for all our members to discuss and plan the Assignment. We have all started on seperating the Assignment into differant sections for us to complete. We are in the proccess of coming up with an group idea. Me personally have been struggling to come up with an idea for a Group Project. Website is coming along nice. I am trying to make it as user friendly as possible.
